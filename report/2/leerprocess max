Learning process Max van Hattum
What I’ve learned working at this project, is to properly coordinate who codes what and to make sure everyone’s code interacts in an efficient good way. 
I also had to read up a lot about php, mysqli, sql, json and xml. Since it was a long time ago that I’ve made a website. Luckily there are enough sources on the internet that explain almost everything in an understandable way. This was particularly handy for working with web API’s, since I had never done this before. Everything about php, mysqli, sql, json and xml I read about on w3schools. I find that they explain everything very clear and it is nice to see the examples and code instantly.
I also had to read up on web API’s, first I read about the difference of rest and soap (http://blog.smartbear.com/apis/understanding-soap-and-rest-basics/), after this I looked through some examples that used the openweathermap API on github and with this in the back of my mind I started trying to access API’s on my own. 
On how to make my own API I found this tutorial very informational: http://www.brenelz.com/blog/how-to-create-a-simple-api-with-php-and-mysql/ . This gave me an idea on how to approach the idea of delivering data in jsonformat to developers.
